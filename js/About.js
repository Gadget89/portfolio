        <b>Bio</b>
        <br></br>
        I was born and raised in Northeastern New Mexico. Growing up in New Mexico I picked up a few hobbies including scoccer, skiing, and I gained my second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. In 2015 I relocated to San Antonio, TX to see what oppertunities a bigger city would have for me. I quickly found many jobs but ultimatly decided that I wanted to start on a new career path. Initally I was just going to "go back to school" but I found that was not time or cost effective for me. Luckily I stumbled upon a boot camp style front end engineering program at a school called The Iron Yard. I am currently attending the program and a little more than half way through it. Follow me through my journey here.
